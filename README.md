Lead by Prof. Xinheng Wang Xi'an Jiaotong-Liverpool university
Acoustic Analysis and Artificial Intelligence

• Built neuro-network by using k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN) and developed a game changing technology to detect the infection of COVID-19 by recording the breath sound on a smartphone
• Conducted a series of signal processing, feature extraction and classification by using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
• The article was collected by Journal of Biomedical Informatics in Nov 2021
